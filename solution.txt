Testing git add from university Linux systems. 
Initially not allowing git add if we use {://https} to clone a repository.

Lets figure it out.

Figured out the solution:
1> Generate the SSH key for the system.
2> SSH key generation: https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key/
3> Navigate to .ssh folder.
4> Open id_rsa.pub in any editor and copy the content.
5> Open git hub profile => navigate to ssh keys.
6> Add new ssh key and give nay name to it, and paste the content you copied earlier.
7> After that go to you local copy and work as usual.
8> git status
9> git add --all
10> git commit -m"Your personal message"
11> IMPORATNT!
12> Use this command to push: git push -u origin master
13> Above command only need to be executed once.
14> After that use git push as normal you would.
15> That is it, we are good to go.
